# Notes for CS 260

## Git & GitHub
- it is easiest to create a repo on GitHub then clone it than push a new repo to GitHub
- clone from GitHub 
   - `git clone https://github.com/url-to-repo-on-github`
- add files to git
    - `git add file.name`
- commit, add, and add message to git
    - `git commit -am "my comments here with proper etiquette:`
- send edits to GitHub
    - `git push`
- check for changes on GitHub
    - `git fetch`
    - `git status`
- when merging, you must review the conflict before finishing the merge

## GitHub forks and pull request
- you can create a fork to a GitHub repo to edit the files independent of the main branch
    - this is how the open souce community developes software
- when you fork a repo and want to add your fork back to the main branch, you can make a pull request
    - this notifies the repo owner that you want to make a change
    - they will either approve it or deny it
